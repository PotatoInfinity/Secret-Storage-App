Introducing Secret Storage App! 🔒 
Tired of forgetting passwords or keeping your private info not-so-private? Say hello to Secret Storage App—your ultimate encrypted vault for secrets! Secret Storage App is here to securely keep your most confidential data—passwords, notes, and secrets—safe and encrypted, all inside simple text files! 
________________________________________
+How Does It Work?
Most apps store data in databases or on the cloud , but Secret Storage App keeps it old-school and private by using local text files! 
✅ Your secrets are stored in text files—no need for fancy, complex databases.
✅ Each entry is encrypted using your password, making the text unreadable without proper decryption.
✅ No internet access required—everything is kept locally on your computer.
But wait… how does it stay secure if it’s just a text file?
- SHA-256 Password Hashing – Your password is converted into an irreversible hash, so even if someone gets the file, they can’t reverse-engineer your password.
- XOR Encryption – Before storing secrets, the app scrambles them using your password as a key, so the actual text is unreadable without knowing the right password.
- Limited Login Attempts – After three failed tries, the app temporarily locks you out, preventing brute-force attacks.
- Deletion Control – Don’t want your secrets anymore? Delete them permanently from the text files with one click.

Why Text Files?
